\section{Energy transport in stellar interiors}

This section contains my notes while studying the fifth chapter in the  ``Theoretical Astrophysics'' lecture notes by Paola Marigo. 

Energy transport phenomena in stellar interiors are classified into: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item those which involve stochastic thermal motion of the particles: this is \emph{heat conduction} if it involves the motion of gas and dust particles, and \emph{radiative diffusion} if it involves the motion of photons;
  \item those which involve bulk motion of particles: this is called \emph{convection}. 
\end{enumerate}
